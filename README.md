This paper contains the R project used in creating the paper about the relationship between age group, gender, and educational level.

Abstract: As income inequaility of individuals arises as a more significant issue in all countries across the world nowadays, it is important for us to understand the leading factors of this social problem. This paper is going to explore how gender, race, education level and other factors influence the income of individuals in the United States in 1994. After our data analysis, we found that men generally had higher income than women, and non-black, non-hispanic americans earned more money. In addition, citizens with higher education degrees had a higher income level than others. We learned that factors including gender and race can lead to a huge gap between people's income, however, today the influence of gender and race on income level is gradually decreasing.
